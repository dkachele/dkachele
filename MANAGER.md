# Manager README

Hello and welcome to my supplemental README as a manager. Please read my individual [README first](https://github.com/dkachele/me/blob/main/ME.md).

## As a manager

My team comes first; the company comes second. I have a responsibility to the company, but I cannot live up to it without a well-operating and highly functional team full of talent.

I am neither an authoritarian nor wish to micromanage anyone; it's not a good use of either of our time. I believe that managers work for their direct reports, and generally, I want to provide you with slightly more challenging work than you feel comfortable with.

I will never throw anyone under the bus and expect the same from you. Outside of our department, our wins will always be yours, and our failures will always be mine.

BTW, I don't take a lunch most days, my wife calls me the food camel, but I tend to graze throughout the day. Your lunch schedule is up to you.

## Our average week

I expect project work, support tickets, individual requests, office visits, etc., to take precedent over Objectives & Goals (O.G.s). I expect this will lead to conflicts; **this is okay**; I expect to discuss these in our weekly 1:1s. O.G.s are not set in stone and can always be adjusted (for a good reason); some weeks, O.G.s will win, and some weeks the fray will win. Telling me you're having trouble with O.G.s in the first month of a quarter is perfectly acceptable; telling me you're having trouble with O.G.s two weeks before they are due isn't. Discussing obstacles and other issues will be critical as we build trust.

We'll have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes unless there is an outage or Armageddon project. This meeting focuses on topics of substance, not updates.... unless you want to talk about updates, it is solely for your benefit. I expect you to drive this meeting, and after we've gone through your agenda, I will likely have a few questions per week.

Bringing an issue or problem to this meeting is not a sign of weakness or failure; having an issue and not utilizing every resource (me in this context) can be. If you miss our 1:1 due to a conflict on your end, it is your responsibility to schedule a makeup, and likewise, if I have a conflict, I will reschedule.

We'll have a department meeting that includes a huddle, weekly team retrospective, sprint planning, and code review every week for 60-90 minutes.

Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let's talk. Heard a rumor? Need clarification on something? Blocked? I'd love to hear about it as soon as possible. Email me, text me, or shoot me a Slack message; we don't need to wait for our next scheduled 1:1. Feel free to put something in my calendar; don't feel like you need to ask first. Is my calendar full? Please send me a message, and I'll likely be able to move something around.

## Communication expectations

I respect both the ability to respond immediately and the need to reflect and get back to me thoughtfully; for the latter, I expect an immediate (within the time expectation outlined below) response that states an estimated time for the thoughtful one.

**Email:** I expect you to read and reply to emails at least once daily; I also expect you to **_not_** check them outside of business hours.

**Slack:** I expect you to read and reply to messages within a few hours; I also expect you to **_not_** check it outside of business hours (there are exceptions, if you fall into this category, you will know it).

**Text:** I expect you to read and reply within 30 minutes, sooner if you want to avoid a phone call.

**Phone call:** I expect you to answer or reply (phone or text) ASAP.

*That said, the maintenance of inboxes (Email, Slack, etc.) is not what you're here to do. Attention is valuable, and I'd prefer you use yours elsewhere.*

## My working assumptions

**That everything is good.** I work under the assumption that everything is going well, including your workload, approaching deadlines, where we stand, relationships with other individuals, etc. Unless you tell me otherwise, my faith in you tells me everything is fine. Never underestimate how little I know about a topic.

**You'll let me know if you can't do your job.** One of my primary responsibilities is ensuring you are set up for success. My job is to remove roadblocks; occasionally, things slip through the cracks, and I won't know I'm letting you down unless you tell me.

## What I value and expect

**Doing it right.** Doing it right will almost always trump doing it fast, except when it doesn't. If you need a second opinion on whether the scope of a project should increase to do it *right*, ask.

**Motivation.** We are all adults here, and I don't track your time, pay attention to when you come and go nor ask you if you need something to do but in return, I'll expect and assume you're working on what you should and will be frustrated if you're not.

**Empowerment/Ownership.** For you that means you are in control of your destiny, and I'm just here to help you get there. For the company, that means I have your back 100% of the time; if you need to make a decision and you can't find me, I'll always back your play (though we may discuss alternative solutions in private later).

## Feedback

There is a huge difference between me telling you that you can do better and me telling you we have a performance problem. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. If you worry that I'm concerned about your performance, please let me know. I can be blunt at times, but I say what I mean, I'm not smart enough for sub-context.

If you have feedback for me, I will expect this feedback also to be as immediate as possible. I am here to help you succeed, but I can't do that if I'm not aware of areas I'm failing you.

P.S. If you're sick, take the day off; if you're somewhat ill, work from home. It's for the betterment of yourself and the department. Whatever you have, I guarantee those that sit close to you don't want it cause I know I don't want it, nor do I want to take it home. **I mean this.** 

*This document is a living, breathing thing and likely incomplete. I update it frequently and would appreciate your feedback and welcome pull requests.*
