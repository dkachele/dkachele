# Dale's README

Hello and welcome to my README. I am thrilled to be working with you. I very much look forward to getting to know you and collaborating with you to build great things.

## Disclaimers

This document applies only to me and does not apply to any other team member.

This document is a compilation of my thoughts and thoughts I've stolen from other READMEs that put it so well I wouldn't dare rewrite it.

## Motivation behind this doc

This readme exists for three reasons:
- Help me identify and refine my thoughts and values.
- Help you understand me better to aid us in working together.
- Help set high-level expectations.

But it is not intended as a substitute for talking and getting to know one another.

It will likely take a solid quarter to get comfortable working together. Businesses are complicated and full of equally complex humans. We'll take our time, meet everyone, go to every meeting, write everything down, and ask all the questions â€“ especially about all those baffling acronyms and emojis in Slack.

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide about me, and it captures what you can expect from the average week working with me, how I like to work, and some of my quirks. I recommend and hope you make one too.

## About me

I am a father and a husband first. Family and personal health should always come first for everyone on this team, and I expect the same from my peers. Never feel bad for taking your PTO; you are not letting the team down; we are on the same team.

I'm pretty open about *everything*, from the latest embarrassing story involving mine or my kids' habits to whatever we watched on Netflix this past weekend. I don't expect everyone to be as open, but I do hope that you talk to me as soon as possible when problems arise. I need that level of immediacy and transparency on issues to help move us all forward.

If I have my headphones on, it typically means I am working in the zone; unless it's an urgent issue, I'd appreciate it if it could Slack me first so I may disengage at the soonest logical point. **If it is essential** interrupt me 100% of the time. If you have your headphones on (or whatever other signals that you are in the zone you wish me to use), I'll do my best not to interrupt you.

I often use humor as a coping mechanism to break the ice, cut the tension, end an awkward moment, or relax a situation. If this bothers you, let me know.

## Communication expectations

You can text me 24 hours a day.

I work a bit at night and on the weekends. This is my choice. *I do not expect the same of anyone.* I might Slack or email you things, but unless a text or phone call accompanies it, it can always wait until work begins for you on your next working day.

## My working assumptions

**That everything is good.** I work under the assumption that everything is going well, including your expectations of me, where we stand, etc. Unless you tell me otherwise, my faith in you tells me everything is fine. Never underestimate how little I know about a topic.

**You're very good at your job.** You wouldn't be here if you weren't. If it feels like I'm questioning you, it's because I'm either: a) trying to gather context or b) trying to be a sounding board.

**I'm not good at your job.** You know best. I'll work to provide the necessary context and ask questions to be constructive.

**You'll do what you say you'll do.** Without exception unless you tell me otherwise.

**You feel safe debating with me.** I find that ideas improve by being examined from all angles. If it sounds like I'm disagreeing, I'm most likely just playing devil's advocate or just wanting to dive a little deeper. This does rely on us being able to have a safe debate.

**You tried first.** I want you to ask for help. I love it when you ask for help. But if you do, I'll assume you tried your hardest before you did. If you didn't, I might be frustrated.

## What I value and expect

**Be curious, not judgmental.** Thanks, Ted.

**If it doesn't work, let's fix it.** This applies to everything; process, applications, workflows, seat arrangements, etc.

**Asking why.** Nothing is sacred, and we don't do anything "because we've always done it that way."

**Self-reflection.** Self-reflection is an essential part of growth. You'll miss opportunities without it.

**Write code for humans, not computers.** We are heard to work on projects together, not impress each other with mental gymnastics.

**Disagree and commit.** Argue for what you think is the right direction, but if the team decides to go a different route, let's commit to making it the best it can be.

**Action.** I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy.

**Awesomeness of small things.** I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing little things.

**Setting expectations.** Setting expectations at the beginning of a meeting/project/initiative/objective are vital to its success. Err on over-communicating.

**We can do anything.** The answer to every question (with enough time, money, and priority.)

**Build for less maintenance tomorrow.** If debating between two paths, take the one that will have less maintenance in the future, except when you can't.

**Being scrappy.** It's never not a startup here.

**Automation.** Automate everything possible. If you do it more than twice, automate it.

**Building to fail.** Assume everything will fail at least some of the time.

**Doing it right.** Doing it right will almost always trump doing it fast, except when it doesn't.

**Initiative.** If you see a problem and no one else is working to fix it, you just volunteered.

**Foresight.** Don't forget to look up from the weeds of the day-to-day craziness to see what's coming next week.

## What will frustrate me

Not knowing what "exceptional work" is.

Having an ego.

Doing work without understanding "Why are we doing it & why now."

Wasting time. (Do **not** read that as R&D or failures are a waste.)

Not investing time to improve your skills, both professional and directly related to your role.

I have little tolerance for indifference and pessimism, even though I joke about them.

## Meetings

My definition of a meeting includes:
- An agenda and/or intended purpose.
- The appropriate amount of productive attendees.
- A responsible party is running the meeting to a schedule.
- Ends with clearly defined owners and timelines.

If it's not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance.

If you send me meeting materials a reasonable amount of time before a meeting, I will read them before the meeting and have my questions ready. If I haven't read them, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it's scheduled to end, let's give the time back to everyone. If it's clear that the intended goal won't be achieved in the allotted time, let's stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## Feedback

I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team. Know this, both personally and professionally, both intellectually and experientially, I want you and me to be happy and fulfilled.

The sooner we learn how to disagree with each other efficiently, the sooner we'll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don't get better with compliance.

If you have feedback for me, I will expect this feedback to be as immediate as possible.

## Tips and tricks

**You can ask me anything**, and the vast majority of the time, I'll tell you what I can. Very infrequently, I won't be able to, but I'm committed to never lying to you.

**Sometimes it takes me time to process news** and at the time, you'll think I've taken this news negatively; trust me, I haven't, sometimes it takes me time to process new (particularly surprising) information. I will follow up once I've had time to decompress.

**I am an introvert.** And that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. Weird, huh? Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok, and any more than eight, you will find that I am strangely quiet. Please do not confuse my quiet with a lack of engagement.

**I'm opinionated, stubborn, and wrong a lot.**  This does not mean they are correct, or you should blindly believe them. Please disprove me so that I can learn with you. I will also admit when I am wrong.

**When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me for clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**I will use my vacation time** and so should you. I can't overstate the importance of not being here.

**Email subject lines** should be overly descriptive of the content to follow; this helps me prioritize on the fly.

**I'm a good listener, except when I'm not.** If I'm not listening, tell me, I will.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness ("Dale, can you help with X?"). I react poorly to being told what to do ("Dale, do X.") I have been this way since I was a kid, and I probably need therapy.

**Be clear upfront.** When you ask, "do you have 5 minutes?" please provide the topic you'd like to discuss; otherwise, I'll think it's terrible news. We're biased toward bad news, and I'm no different.

**I am a shipbuilder.** I love to build great things but have no desire to captain the boat.

**I can be hyperbolic.** I can argue passionately, but it's almost always because I am excited about the topic.

**I also swear a lot.** Sorry. ðŸ¤¬
